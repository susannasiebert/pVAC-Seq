Features
========

**SNVS and InDel support**

pVAC-Seq offers epitope binding predictions for missense, inframe indel, and frameshift mutations.

**VCF support**

pVAC-Seq uses a single-sample VCF file as its input. The only prerequisite is annotation of the user's VCF file with VEP. See the :ref:`prerequisites_label` for more information.

**No local install of epitope prediction software**

pVAC-Seq utilizes the IEDB RESTful web interface. This means that none of the underlying prediction software, like NetMHC, needs to be installed locally.

**MHC Class I and Class II predictions**

Both MHC Class I and Class II predictions are supported. Simply choose the desired prediction algorithms and HLA alleles during processing and Class I and Class II prediction results will be written to their own respective subdirectories in your output directory.

By using the IEDB RESTful web interface, pVAC-Seq is leveraging their extensive support of different prediction algorithms.

**Comprehensive filtering**

Automatic filtering on the binding affinity ic50 value narrows down the results to only include "good" candidate peptides. The binding filter threshold can be adjusted by the user for each pVAC-Seq run, and additional filtering can be manually done by the user on the final result file to narrow down the candidate epitopes even further.

bam-readcount and cufflinks files can be provided by the user as additional input files and are used to extract coverage and expression data. When any bam-readcount or cufflinks files are provided, automatical filtering with adjustable thresholds on depth, VAF, and/or expression value will narrow down the results. The user can also manually run the coverage filter to further narrow down their results from the final output file.

The user can also specify an option to only keep the top scoring result for each allele-peptide length combination for each variant.

**NetChop and NetMHCstab integration**

Cleavage position predictions are added with optional processing through NetChop.

Stability predictions can be added if desired by the user. These predictions are obtained via NetMHCstab.
