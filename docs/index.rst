pVAC-Seq
====================================

Cancer immunotherapy has gained significant momentum from recent clinical successes of checkpoint blockade inhibition. Massively parallel sequence analysis suggests a connection between mutational load and response to this class of therapy. Methods to identify which tumor-specific mutant peptides (neoantigens) can elicit anti-tumor T cell immunity are needed to improve predictions of checkpoint therapy response and to identify targets for vaccines and adoptive T cell therapies. Here, we provide a cancer immunotherapy pipeline for the identification of **p**\ ersonalized **V**\ ariant **A**\ ntigens by **C**\ ancer **Seq**\ uencing (pVAC-Seq) that integrates tumor mutation and expression data (DNA- and RNA-Seq). http://www.genomemedicine.com/content/8/1/11
